For this data portrait, I tracked every song I listened to for a week. I noticed that even though I listened to tons of music, I kept returning to the same three songs:

Champagne Coast — 17 plays (art pop, r&b soul, indie pop)

Simulation Swarm —13 plays (indie, folk, alternative)

What You Like — 9 plays (electronic, house, dance)

So instead of charting everything, I turned each one into a color mode you can switch using SPACE, kind of like my own Spotify visualizer? I kept the layout minimal and centered like Spotify's.. I wanted to make something that I could se in the app as an emotional waveform view.

From class, I used:

let variables to control animation speed, sound levels, and state

for loops to draw multiple wave rows instead of repeating code manually

constrain() to make sure the waves stayed inside the frame

Interaction functions like mousePressed() and keyPressed() so the viewer can pause or swap moods

Some other of the functions, I learned off youtube, I have really been invested in sound and how it interacts, in my Major Studio I did a project on Touch Designer and it kind of mirrors this one so, I've been really trying to familiarize myself with these different ways to play with soundwaves and sound.

What I learned: When making this, I wanted to explore how sound and mood overlap. It was interesting to think about rhythm in a visual way rather than just as audio. I can see myself using this system in future projects to track emotions through movement instead of just numbers like traditional Spotify stats.
