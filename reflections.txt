When I started brainstorming my optical illusion, I wanted to make a ball that you could drag around the screen while a pattern followed it everywhere. The hardest part was trying to include the required nested loops. Every time I added them, they either wouldn’t show up or they messed with the movement of the sphere. At one point I tried using a sparkle effect in the background, but it limited how far the ball could move. I also had a really really hard time trying to add a text in the bottom that said drag to move, because it would cause it to be blurry. 

Reflection / What I Learned:
I eventually figured out how to turn the sparkles into a nested loop that stays in the background without interfering. This taught me that sometimes you have to rethink where you place your code instead of deleting it. I also learned how interaction and visuals can clash if you don’t organize your functions carefully. In the end, getting the sparkles and the movement to work together made the illusion feel more alive, I ended up not figuring out how to add the text in time but will get help for next time.
