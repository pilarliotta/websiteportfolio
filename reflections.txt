Description of my Exquisite Corpse –
My exquisite corpse was a collaboration with Gabe and Aaron. They drew the head and legs on paper and texted me the image, and I finished the body digitally before moving it into code. I gave the character a pink unitard, buttons, and buff emoji arms, and I call him Mister Man. He’s just here to have fun and show his arms. Aaron added the hearts and socks, which brought a silly vibe to the design, so I decided the unitard was the best way to connect everything.
Reflection and what I learned –
Taking a physical drawing into code felt surreal to me because we were combining separate parts into one figure, but it made the project more fun. I learned how to use user-defined functions with arguments and parameters to keep my sketch organized. It was confusing at first since I wasn’t in class, but I think I figured out how to make it work. This project showed me that collaboration across different mediums can lead to unexpected and playful results.
